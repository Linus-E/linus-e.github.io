<H2>Cinema club: one film per year, one film a week</H2>
<P style="text-align: right; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">
<A href="../../index.html" class=home>home</A>

<P>
Watching The Simpsons with my kids, I realised just how many references to old movies they hadn't seen were in the show. We decided to remedy this with a project to explore the history of film, each week watching a single movie taken from each year in turn since the first film was shot, starting, in the first week, with 
<A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundhay_Garden_Scene">Roundhay Garden Scene</A> (1888). It went pretty well, so I thought I'd post details incase anyone wanted to try something similar. If you're not bothered about the 
caveats, cribs, and construction, you can <A href="#list">skip to the list</A> avoiding the preamble, but half the 
fun is probably making your own.
</P>
<HR>
<P> 
So, I picked movies based on a combination of the following:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
the kids hadn't seen it;
</LI>
<LI>
it was appropriate for kids (see caveats below);
</LI>
<LI>
all the major film movements and developments were represented;
</LI>
<LI>
the films were culturally significant now;
</LI>
<LI>
films that represented quality film-making.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
So, below is the list if anyone wants to try something similar; though half the fun is picking for yourself. 
There's some excellent <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_years_in_film">pages on Wikipedia for each year</A>, which are helpful. The main pages are quite US centred, so we also used the Wikipedia 
pages listing "<A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_British_films_by_year">British films by year</A>". Generally I took release dates, but each film is +/- a year, as sometimes I cheated and 
took production dates, and sometimes films went on short pre-releases or were re-released; in some cases, early films are also dated differently by different sources. I tried to make sure non-English language films were represented, though Anglo-American cultural importance generally ruled, as the key idea was to see the foundations of that rather than introduce new stuff (that's another project!). 
In some cases where a choice was impossible, we watched two films in a year, though we tried to limit ourselves &ndash; in some cases it was because a film was important to British culture, but there was also 
one that was more important to general film development. 
 I've suggested alternatives in some years where we'd already seen the major films. In most cases I got the films on DVD, but I don't doubt a lot can be found online, especially the earlier ones. For the first few years, we actually watched pretty much everything extant that was filmed: there's 
<A href="https://shop.bfi.org.uk/early-cinema-primitives-and-pioneers-dvd-bluray.html">a good DVD by the BFI</A>, but you rapidly have to start choosing. Info in the list is pulled from the DVDs or linked 
web sources, with apologies for the lack of space for proper references &ndash; I've tried to make personal speculations obvious. 
</P>
<P>
The "child-suitable" rule is probably the hardest to judge if you're doing this yourself &ndash; my kids won't be the same as anyone else's, and British kids will be different to those from other places. 
Some films you think should be disturbing don't bother children, and vice versa. It should be noted that many of the films contain stereotypes and humour you wouldn't find in modern films, but these are a 
good opportunity to discuss how far we've come with children. I've commented occasionally on content below, but the best thing is to check the parental guidance for each film on 
<A href="https://www.imdb.com/">IMDb</A> for yourself. 
</P>

<P>
Overall, I think my kids enjoyed it. My eldest was 13 when we started and watched everything. My youngest was 7, watched a lot of silent movies, but dropped out for most of the colour period as they weren't normal, but also weren't exotic. My middle child was 11, and watched almost everything. I found the silent movies to be the hardest ask, so we actually mixed in quite a lot of out-of-sequence Laurel and Hardy, Buster Keaton, and Charlie Chaplin 
<A href="https://shop.bfi.org.uk/charlie-chaplin-the-mutual-comedies-1916-1917-dvd.html">Mutuals</A>, all of which went down well as light relief. Anyhow, here's the list as we did it. Next we're 
tackling animation and then TV and pop music.

This film by Louis Lumi&egrave;re of the <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_and_Louis_Lumi%C3%A8re">Lumi&egrave;re brothers</A> is probably the first film story, and comedy. Also important this year are

<A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Execution_of_Mary_Stuart">The Execution of Mary Stuart</A>, which include two early special effects &ndash; a wall being knocked down and 
then springing up again as the film is re-played in reverse, and the first use of a <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_splice">stop motion substitution</A>. The latter is

<A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peeping_Tom_(1897_film)">Peeping Tom</A>, which represent the start of a

Another year where you just have to watch two films. The influence of Metropolis on science fiction is hard to overestimate. Especially interesting is the 
sequence shot from the first person perspective, which could be from a modern computer game. However, as the man says, "Wait a minute, wait a minute, you ain't heard nothin' yet!": 
it would be harder still to overestimate the importance of The Jazz Singer. While the history of sound in film is complicated, and this wasn't the first successful 
recorded sound film (1926's <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Juan_(1926_film)">Don Juan</A> included incidental sounds and a recorded score), with the Jazz Singer 
Warner Bros. gave us the first widely available "talkie", and showed that sound was attractive to audiences. Within a remarkably short time, the silent movie was dead. Get the

Another year where only two will do, though your milage may vary depending on your children. All Quiet on the Western Front is 
 one of the best war films ever made. Like The General (1926), I love that it concentrates on the individual human struggle while 
humanity's worst epic plays out in the middle distance (quiet interiors with one open wall onto chaos are a particular speciality, though the 
story of a pair of boots is also hellishly poignant). Un Chien Andalou is equally great, and influential, though some may judge the slicing up eyeballs, nudity, and 
light fondling, beyond their kids. Personally, in the Venn diagram of The Pixies and Dali, I know exactly where I want my kids to be.

Here, <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tramp">The Tramp</A>, 
first seen in 1914, deals with the struggle of humanity in the industrial age, a theme not much explored since 
Metropolis (1927). It's a testament to the quality of Chaplin's work that he could continue doing silent characters for almost 10 years after The Jazz Singer (1927) changed everything, well into what 
feels like a completely different and modernised world. Finally, however, in this film, he breaks, and, of course, when he does, he does it with style: singing a song in glossolalial gibberish.

Astonishing wartime film by <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powell_and_Pressburger">Powell and Pressburger</A> 
that was almost guarenteed to offend everyone: the military (who disliked <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Blimp">Blimp</A>) and the 
public (who were presented with a semi-sympathetic German officer). The overarching theme that the British were far too tied to notions of decency, and 
each generation could rightly fight as dirtily as their enemies demanded, presumably came from <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emeric_Pressburger">Pressburger's</A> 
first-hand experience of the NAZIs, but it certainly stuck a knife into the moral highground of the "Your Britain Fight For It Now" propaganda of the time. One of those 
films people probably agreed with more in their hearts than they were prepared to admit; at their peril.  
A good opportunity to discuss the contribution of film to public debates.

a disquietening family film, but well worth the effort. I especially love that it's beautifully shot in a mix of Western perspective and flattened surfaces that replicate traditional Japanese picture screens, and that the 
film shooting replicates the story, with its tragic meeting of traditional Eastern and modern Western sensibilities. Contrast this with the meeting of rebellious young and conservative 
old in the American classic The Wild One: more than any other, the film that encapsulated and embedded the rise of the teenager as cultural leader. What are they rebelling against? Whaddaya got?

saved The Wild One (1953) for this week). Kiss Me Deadly is my favourite noir, and while the (not final) reveal could be better handled for 
a modern audience, the <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</A> is the best you'll find. Night of the Hunter and

in the end 12 Angry Men won through on philosophy and style. Shooting largely in one room 
builds the claustrophobic atmosphere, and I love that <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fonda">Fonda's</A> methodical dissection still allows space for

The gods of film will have to forgive me for pairing up these two and ignoring <A href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061811/">In the Heat of the Night</A>, but 
the Carry On movies are so central to the British psyche, they're unavoidable. Khyber (actually from 1968) is rightly remembered for its stoic dinner party scene, but the British 
are as affectionately sent up and, to a degree, lauded in the lesser-known Camel. Camel's rather loose attitude to sexual consent strikes a queasy note now, but generally 
both are on the guilty-pleasure side of the line.

aspiration, pretension, and personal development interlock.  In the unlikely event you haven't seen

Fun movie about film-making. I wonder how long they debated using the 
<A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Test">Screen test</A> 
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CpdoPX8Y28">theme tune</A> before deciding against it?

I was sorely tempted by <A href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1186830/">Agora</A>, but Whip It won for its 
attitude. Perhaps taking a little something from the <A href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075148/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Rocky</A> films, 
<A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Barrymore">Barrymore</A> redefines winning: sports competitions are lost; people get bruised; 
relationships are told to take a hike; but despite it all 
the main characters still come out having won at everything actually worth caring about.

I <EM>really</EM> wanted this to be <A href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1646975/">Le Quattro Volte</A>, but, probably doing my kids a 
disservice, thought that after two years of my film taste, this might be pushing everyone's limits. Scott Pilgrim is fun, and 
has a sensibility that encompasses everything from 80's chiptunes to modern anime, somehow staying on the right side of cool throughout.

We end where we started, back in the silent era, with tone and effects to match and a film that shows again how good cinematography and 
physical storytelling can hold the attention all on their own. A film that takes over 100 years of knowledge and 
techniques and builds an absolute blinder.
