<P>
For a materialist, art is surely one of the ways the universe comes to know itself, sitting at the boundary between consciousness and the void from which consciousness emerges; between sentience and physical nature. Forms emerge on this interface, patterns set dancing in some strange progress by forces on either side of the conscious/unconscious boundary.
</P>
<P>
The Jungian archetypes are one such set of patterns, and these objects hope to show that, like other forms bubbling at this surface, archetypes are not unchanging, but form ever evolving shapes that help us to engage as part of this strange procession.  
</P>
<P>
The method by which these archetypal objects are identified is to scan the liminal litoral without thought until the eye fixes on an object which appears as an expression of these currents and which reveals the surrounding tides in the form of a potential structure and an indication of the associated archetype. 
</P>
<P>
In revealing the fresh shape of these archetypes at the boundary, new movements are encouraged in obscure directions. These objects are, therefore, an extrusion of an indeterminate magic into both the conscious and unconscious spheres.
